  Welcome to the CentOS Debuginfod Service ! <br>
  </div>
  This server provides ELF or DWARF debugging information, covering all packages and architectures of recent versions of CentOS Stream (Currently 8-Stream and 9-Stream). It works by periodically indexing all relevant RPMs from build systems, and extracting any needed file on the fly. Debugger-type tools automatically request files one by one. After being downloaded, each file is stored in a cache under your home directory, where the tools can immediately use it. <br><br>
  More informations can be found on the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Debuginfod">dedicated Fedora wiki page</a> for how to use debuginfod, but basically using the following setting should work for CentOS systems <br><br>
